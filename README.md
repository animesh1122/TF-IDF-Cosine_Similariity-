# TF-IDF-Cosine_Similariity-


In this assignment, you will implement the TF-IDF and Cosine similarity to compute the similarity
between documents. 

# Data:
You can find 10 txt files in the Data folder. Those are the documents in your corpus that you need
to process.

# Tasks: 

# Step 1: Tokenization.
# Step 2: Stopword Removal.
# Step 3: Stemming/Lemmatization.
# Step 4: Compute TF-IDF.
# Step 5: Compute the Cosine Similarity.
